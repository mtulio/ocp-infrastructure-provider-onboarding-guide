The following list is meant to give a general idea of the work involved with this process, the links contained within the list reference documents with greater detail for each step. Workflow Preparation Start with an idea to add a new infrastructure provider to OpenShift. Identify contacts within Red Hat, and the community, and then set expectations about the process ahead. Information Gathering Define the reference architecture and toplogy for OpenShift clusters on the new provider. Inventory existing components including licenses and plugin providers, and identify supported formats and infrastructure. OpenShift Enhancement Create an enhancment describing the new platform in detail, this will become a part of the official OpenShift enhancements . Cloud Controller Manager New providers must have a Cloud Controller Manager integrated into OpenShift, including a repository in the OpenShift organization and container images included in the release payload. Container Storage Interface Driver Providers that expose storage options must have a CSI driver integrated into OpenShift, including a repository in the OpenShift organization and container images inclujded in the release payload. Machine API Controllers New providers must have a Machine actuator, and related controllers, for the Machine API Operator , including a repository in the OpenShift organization and container images included in the release payload. Network Ingress and DNS Evaluate provider-specific support for ingress load balancers and endpoint publishing strategies, as well as internal and external DNS support. Update and validate the Cluster Ingress Operator for the new infrastructure provider. Continuous Integration and Testing All components must have a suite of automation including unit style testing (run in isolation), and integration testing (run on cluster from the provider). This automation is part of the OpenShift development and release process, and exists within the OpenShift organization. Component Infrastructure Once OpenShift can be installed and operated on the new infrastructure platform attention should be given to the dynamic infrastructure services. These components are non-critical to the installation process and include things like the image registry. Documentation Product documentation is required for installation and maintenance tasks on the new infrastructure platform. Source level documentation is expected for all component repositories added to the OpenShift organization. Red Hat Relationship After the new infrastructure provider is ready for release, what are the commitments around maintenance and future releases. Release What to do once the code is approved and the release is ready for public consumption. How to promote and advertise, and work with Red Hat.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"This document provides a high level view of the workflow for adding a new infrastructure provider to OpenShift.
